> To insert images into a mail merge template, we recommend using the
[Aspose DocumentBuilder](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/insert-picture-in-document/),
which programmatically retrieves and inserts images during the merge process. This approach provides
a more stable and maintainable solution than relying on the `INCLUDEPICTURE` mail merge field.
